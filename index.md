## Drafted Players vs Starting Lineup
Comparison of how many initially drafted players were in the starting lineup week by week. Naturally those numbers were almost 9 for everyone in the first week, but this diminished as the season went on. Especially towards the last few weeks where COVID numbers were high.

> Some leagues are really won at the draft, like they say 😜
